Reproduction of a homemade cartridge i got a while simply named the "Astercart rev5" I found another person with a similar cart on Twitter ( @retroWizzard ) who gave me the romdump from his cartridge. 

Because i liked this cartridge and figured others probably would aswell i decided to make a resproduction  of it.

Changes i made was removd 2 IC pads that was not used and i added a jumper header to choose between using my 27C801 multicart ROM and @RetroWizards 27C1001 Giana Sisters rom. I also added a LED and a Reset button.
